## Summary

The primary users of the Artisan Woodworks website fall into two distinct categories:

**Public Users (Customers):** Quality-conscious individuals and business clients seeking custom, handcrafted furniture. They value authenticity, craftsmanship, and natural materials. The website must immediately convey luxury and quality through visual presentation while making it easy for users to browse the portfolio, understand the process, and contact the company. Mobile experience is critical for individual customers, while desktop experience is more important for business clients. Bilingual support (EN/BG) is essential to serve both local and international markets.

**Admin Users (Content Managers):** The business owner (Petri) and developer (Melwin) who manage the website content. The admin panel must be simple, intuitive, and forgiving for the non-technical business owner who needs to independently add and manage products without developer assistance. Clear feedback, plain language, and obvious actions are critical. The developer needs robust error handling and minimal maintenance requirements.
